Creating content
It all starts with data. We want our database to resemble the knowledge and processes that physicians use daily. That is why our medical team built a complex network of interlinked medical concepts. This framework allows us to assess patient's symptoms in a similar way to doctors, by simultaneously analyzing symptoms, conditions, and risk factors.

Probabilistic modeling
Expert medical knowledge is used by our inference algorithms to process patients' data and draw conclusions on their health. It is also used as a part of the feedback loop to continuously improve our solutions over time. With care and precision, our team links medical content with our inference engine to guide millions of patients to the right level of care.
